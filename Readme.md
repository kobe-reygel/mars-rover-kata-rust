## Mars Rover Kata Rust

Repository that tries to implement a Mars Rover Kata in Rust.
This is motivated by an exploration of how Rust might fit into
enterprise software development/ a DDD environment.

If anyone coming across this has any pointers/thoughts on this codebase, or on Rust + DDD in general, I'd love to hear them!

kata from https://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata

This kata will be implemented using strict TDD. It will be build out in steps per requirement.
For evolution of codebase see the git log.
